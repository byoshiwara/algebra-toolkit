<subsection><title>1. Find the slope of a line</title> 

<introduction><p>We can tell whether two lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither by comparing their slopes.</p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Find the slope of the line  <m>~6x-8y = 9</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The easiest way to find the slope of this line is to put its equation into slope-intercept form by solving for <m>y</m>. 
    <md><mrow>-8y \amp = -6x+9</mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = \dfrac{-6x+9}{-8} = \dfrac{3}{4}x - \dfrac{9}{8}</mrow></md>
The slope of the line is <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m>.</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Find the slope of the line whose intercepts are <m>(112,0)</m> and <m>(0,140)</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We use the slope formula.
        <me>m = \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \dfrac{140-0}{0-112} = \dfrac{140}{-112} = \dfrac{-5}{4}</me></p></solution>

<subsection><title>2. Use the point-slope formula</title> 

<introduction><p>Recall the point-slope formula for finding the equation of a line:
    <me>y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)</me></p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Find the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line of slope <m>\dfrac{-2}{3}</m> that passes through <m>(-8,9)</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We first use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line.
        <md><mrow>y-9 \amp = \dfrac{-2}{3}(x+8)  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Multiply by 3 to clear the fraction.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>3y-27 \amp = -2x-16 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Add 27 to both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>3y \amp = -2x+11 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 3.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp = \dfrac{-2}{3}x + \dfrac{11}{3}</mrow></md>
The <m>y</m>-intercept of the line is <m>\left(0, \dfrac{11}{3}\right)</m>.</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Find the equation of the line with <m>x</m>-intercept <m>(2,0)</m> that passes through <m>(-3,-3)</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We first compute the slope, using the two points given.
    <me>m =  \dfrac{0+3}{2+3} = \dfrac{3}{5}</me>
Now we can use the point-slope formula.
    <md><mrow>y-0 \amp = \dfrac{3}{5}(x-2) \amp \amp \blert{\text{Multiply by 5 to clear the fraction.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>5y \amp = 3x-6  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 5.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = \dfrac{3}{5}x - \dfrac{6}{5}</mrow></md></p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>3. Use properties of geometric figures.</title> 

<introduction><p>Analytic geometry uses algebra to help solve geometric problems.</p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>The figure shows isosceles triangle <m>ABC</m> and its altitude <m>\overline{AP}</m>. (Recall that the altitude of a triangle is the segment perpendicular to the base that passes through the opposite vertex.) For this problem, we'll use the following property:</p>
<p>  In an isoceles triangle, the altitude bisects the base.</p> <p><ol label="a">
    <li>Find the equation of the line that includes </m>\overline{AP}</m>.</li>
    <li>Find the coordinates of point <m>P</m>.</li>
    <li>Find the length of the segment </m>\overline{AP}</m>.</li></ol></p></statement>
